# Why a CLI?

---

Most people prefer to use an ide

and a terminal for their coding works.

---

Not just that we also have a

vim plugin

---

## Features (CLI):
- View contests
- View problems in a very nice cross platform tui.
- View ranklist.
- Submit solutions to problems and view results.
- And much more...

---

## Usage and documentation

Visit: codechef-cli.rtfd.io

---
## Architecture
- Lazy loaded commands
- Easily extendable
- Easily testable (all though lacking code coverage as of now)
---
